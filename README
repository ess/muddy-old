MUDdy
-----

Muddy started out as a desire to give another client, Muby, a prettier UI.

That's still about all that it is, but the only thing that actually came
from Muby was the connection code.

Usage
-----
/path/to/muddy.rb server port

Example
-------
./muddy.rb scrymud.net 4444

Scripting
---------
There's pretty limited scripting support at the moment.  I'm working on
adding triggers to the scripting interface, but they're not quite ready (read
"I haven't started on it, as I wanted to get this bastard uploaded before my
connection dropped for the week").

To use user scripts, just drop them in a file in ~/.muddy called
user_methods.rb

There is an example user_methods.rb in the examples directory of the Muddy
source.  Please feel free to use this as a basis for your scripts.
